# Malware-Detection

## Objective
Malware detectors that are based on signatures can perform well on previously-known malware, that was already discovered by some anti-virus vendors. However, it is unable to detect polymorphic malware, that has the ability to change its signatures, as well as new malware, for which signatures have not been created yet. In turn, the accuracy of heuristics-based detectors is not always sufficient for adequate detection, resulting in a lot of false positives and false negatives. (Baskaran and Ralescu 2016).

## Existing Methods

Although not widely implemented, the concept of machine learning methods for malware detection is not new. Several types of studies were carried out in this field, aiming to figure the accuracy of different methods.

“Malware Detection Using Machine Learning” Dragos Gavrilut aimed for developing a detection system based on several modified perceptron algorithms. For different algorithms, he achieved the accuracy of 69.90%- 96.18%. It should be stated that the algorithms that resulted in best accuracy also produced the highest number of false-positives: the most accurate one resulted in 48 false positives. The most balanced algorithm with appropriate accuracy and the low false-positive rate had the accuracy of 93.01%.

## Specific Project requirements

###	Data Requirement
The two data set that we have used in this project can be found in Kaggle.com
While installing/running this project, the used does not need to install the module from Kaggle, it is already provided in the project file.

###	Functional Requirement
Modules used (while installation):
- sklearn 0.24.1
-	pyfiglet 0.8.post1
-	pefile
-	joblib 1.1.0

###	Look and Feel Requirement

As the whole project’s interface is terminal based and the only visuals we used is in the main screen, so only for printing the ASCII art on the home screen the user needs to install pyfiglet which is a python library which converts the strings to ASCII art.

## Performance Analysis

- The Accuracy percentage of Random Forest Classifier: 99.37% 
- The Accuracy of Logistic Regression: 98.46%
- The Precision of Logistic Regression: 99.18% 
- The Recall of Logistic Regression: 96.25%

## Future Enhancements
- Use a wider, well-labelled dataset.
- Instead of only hosting it in our local system, we can upload it in the web and provide the feature of uploading files to be checked and also create a section for URL detector.
- GUI based program can be made for windows, as of now it is only made for terminal.
- Real time scanning of every file while downloading/transferring can be done to be used in daily life scenario to detect malicious files.

## Contributing
First you need to clone this repo, you can do this using


After clone this repo, open the terminal in that location and install all the dependencies of the project using,

``` pip install -r requirement.text ```

Now you can use the project in your local machine, if you wish to make any changes in the repo then you first need to make a new branch and switch to that new branch using

```
git branch new-branch
git checkout new-branch
```
After changing your current branch, make change locally and then add all those changes in your branch and then fianlly commit

```
git add .
git commit -m "<comment>"
```

After successfully commiting the changes you need to push the code using,

```
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
```
After pushing the changes you are now good to send the pull request and after evaluation we can commit it in the main-branch.
